🏐 Volleyball Player Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of professional volleyball players using statistical data related to their individual skills and positions. The goal is to gain insights into player strengths, compare performance across roles (e.g., Outside Hitter vs. Opposite), and potentially inform team-building or scouting decisions.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains player-level volleyball performance metrics, including attacking, blocking, serving, and receiving abilities.

📄 Sample Data
Player	Country	Age	Attack	Block	Serve	Set	Dig	Receive	Position
Ichikawa Yuki	Japan	28	15.80	1.13	1.40	0.07	4.80	5.60	OH
Romano Yuri	Italy	26	12.33	1.07	1.47	0.00	3.87	0.00	OP
Abdel-Aziz Nimir	Nederland	31	15.33	0.67	2.08	0.00	3.17	0.25	OP
Herrera Jaime Jesus	Cuba	28	15.00	0.92	1.75	0.00	3.33	0.17	OP
Takahashi Ran	Japan	22	11.53	0.67	1.00	0.07	6.40	5.07	OH
🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on player performance.

Compare players by position (OH vs. OP).

Identify key performance metrics contributing to overall excellence.

Spot trends by age, country, or role.

📊 Features Explained

Attack: Points scored through attacking hits.

Block: Points from successful blocks.

Serve: Points scored directly from serving.

Set: Set assists or effectiveness.

Dig: Defensive saves from opponent attacks.

Receive: Ability to receive and control the serve.

Position:

OH: Outside Hitter

OP: Opposite Spiker

🔧 Possible Analysis Directions

🧮 Statistical comparison between OHs and OPs.

📈 Correlation between age and performance.

🌍 Performance comparison by country.

⭐ Identifying top performers per skill.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

🚀 How to Use
